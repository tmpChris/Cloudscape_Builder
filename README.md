A repo for the build template for Cloudscape responsive emails. 

## About
Created as a responsive email design workflow by Chris Jefferies

## Install

it's pretty easy, but one of the `npm` dependencies isn't up to date, so you have to do that *manually*.

### Step 1:
`cd` to wherever you want your local files, then, 

`git clone https://github.com/tmpChris/Cloudscape_Builder`



### Step 2:
`cd Cloudscape_Builder`

...then...

`npm install`

### Step 3:
`git clone https://github.com/tmpChris/Cloudscape_Builder/node_modules/grunt-inline-css/`





The grunt-inline-css folder needs to be updated manually with the new juice library. Instructions to follow.
